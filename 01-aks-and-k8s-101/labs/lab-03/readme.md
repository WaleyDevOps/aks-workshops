# lab-03 - Containerizing your application

## Estimated completion time - xx min

To work with and learn Kubernetes commands we need a test application that we will deploy. I will use the simplest version of `ASP.NET Core Web API` with `WeatherForecast` controller. We will add Docker support, containerize it, push to the Azure Container Registry (ACR) and will run it in AKS.

## Goals

* Get familiar with our test application
* Add Docker support 
* Learn how to create docker image
* Learn how to build and push docker image to Azure Container Registry with `az acr build` command 
* Learn how to run application at AKS
* Learn how to use port forward to test application

## Prerequisites

First, check that all Prerequisites are installed
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* Check that Visual Studio `.NET Core cross-platform development` workload is installed. If you already have VS installed, you can modify it from `Visual Studio Installer`. If you do a fresh install, you can select workloads during installation.

## Task #1 - open and build application

Use Visual Studio community edition and open `app\apps.sln` solution. 
If you use other IDE, like Rider or VS Code, feel free to use them as long as you can follow along. Note, some of the VS functionality will not be available, but you can add files, generated by Visual Studio manually.

Now, build `Ctrl+Shift+B` and run your application. It should open the following URL `http://localhost:5000/WeatherForecast` in your default browser and show the json, with list of weather forecast items.
If it doesn't build, check the errors, fix them and build again.


## Task #2 - add Docker support

To add Docker support to your web api app, right-click the `api-a` project, navigate to `Add`, and select `Docker Support`.

![add-docker-support](images/vs-add-docker-support.png)

Make sure that `Linux` is selected and click `OK`.

![add-docker-support](images/vs-add-docker-support-os.png)

Visual Studio will create a `Dockerfile` for you, which defines how to create the container image for your web api project. It will also add new execution profile called `Docker`

![add-docker-support](images/vs-docker-support-profile.png)

If you select it and run the application, it will be running in the Docker.


Once we have tested our application and it works, we can package it as a container image and publish it to the Azure Container Registry. There are multiple ways we can do it, so let's try 3 of them.

## Task #3 - publish `api-a` container to a Azure Container Registry using Visual Studio

 The simplest way is to use Visual Studio click-ops:

1. Right-click your project in Solution Explorer and choose `Publish`.
2. On the Publish dialog, select `Docker Container Registry`.

![deploy-to-acr-step1](images/publish-to-acr-step1.png)

3. Choose Create New Azure Container Registry.

![deploy-to-acr-step2](images/publish-to-acr-step2.png)

4. Fill in your desired values in the `Azure Container Registry` screen. At this step, you may be asked to login to your Azure account.

![deploy-to-acr-step3](images/publish-to-acr-step3.png)

If you follow our naming convention, the resource group should be `iac-aks-ws1-rg` and your ACR name should be `iacaksws1<YOU-NAME>`.

5. When all is set, click `Publish`

![deploy-to-acr-step4](images/publish-to-acr-step4.png)

Visual Studio is now will build and push container to the ACR registry. 

6. Check ACR registry at the Azure portal

Navigate to Azure portal and search for your ACR. You can use search at the top of the portal 

![search-acr](images/portal-acr-1.png)

Navigate to `Repositories`, select repository `apia` and choose `latest` image. 

![acr](images/portal-acr-2.png)

Here you can find metadata about container image, image url and example of command how to pull it with docker.

## Task #4 - build and publish image with Docker command

Once we have a working binary, we can use Docker to package it.
Run the following command from within `api-a` project folder.
```bash
# Use the Dockerfile to build a new apia image.
docker build -t apia:1.0.0 -f Dockerfile ..

# Get list of available images, check that new image is in the list
docker image list
```

After building the image, use Docker to verify that it works as expected.

```bash
# Start an instance of your newly created docker image.
docker run -d apia:1.0.0

# Use docker ps to get the container's ID
docker ps

docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND               CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                   NAMES
41413d9e8c9d   apia:1.0.0           "dotnet api-a.dll"    19 seconds ago   Up 18 seconds   80/tcp                  awesome_montalcini
76ba439c94a4   apia:dev             "tail -f /dev/null"   18 minutes ago   Up 18 minutes   0.0.0.0:49154->80/tcp   api-a
```

Push the Image to ACR

```bash
# login to ACR
az acr login --name iacaksws1<YOU-NAME>
Login Succeeded

# Use docker tag to create an alias of the image with the fully qualified path to your ACR registry.
docker tag apia:1.0.0 iacaksws1<YOU-NAME>.azurecr.io/apia:1.0.0

# Now that you've tagged the image with the fully qualified path to your private registry, you can push it to the registry with docker push
docker push iacaksws1<YOU-NAME>.azurecr.io/apia:1.0.0
```
If command runs successful, check the ACR at the Azure portal. Now `apia` registry should have 2 versions of the image.

![acr1](images/portal-acr-4.png)


## Task #5 - build and publish container images with `az acr build` command

Yet another way you can build and push your images using `az acr build` cli command. To do so, run the following command from within the `api-a` project folder. Note that this time we used `:v1` as a image version.

```powershell
az acr build --registry iacaksws1<YOU-NAME> --image apia:v1 --file Dockerfile ..
```
If command runs successful, check the ACR at the Azure portal. Now `apia` registry should have 3 versions of the image.

![acr1](images/portal-acr-3.png)

## Task #6 - run command at Azure Kubernetes Cluster

Now that we have image at the ACR, and our AKS cluster is integrated with ACR, we can run this image at the AKS

```powershell
kubectl run app-a --image iacaksws1<YOU-NAME>.azurecr.io/apia:v1
pod/app-a created
```

Now you can check the status of the your application 

```powershell
kubectl get po -w
NAME    READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
app-a   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          9s
app-a   1/1     Running             0          12s
```

`-w` flag is a short version of `--watch` and after listing/getting the requested object, it will watch for changes. As you can see, `app-a` pod was first in `ContainerCreating` state and then eventually changed the status to `Running`.

We can check application logs by running the following command

```powershell
kubectl logs app-a
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Now listening on: http://[::]:80
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Production
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /app
```

if you want to continuously observe logs, use `-f` flag

```powershell
kubectl logs app-a -f
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Now listening on: http://[::]:80
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Production
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /app
```

## Task #7 - use port-forward to test application

```powershell
kubectl port-forward app-a 7000:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:7000 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:7000 -> 80
```
