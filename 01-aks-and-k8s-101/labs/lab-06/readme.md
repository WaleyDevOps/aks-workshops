# lab-06 - Deployments

## Estimated completion time - xx min

Deployments abstract away the low level details of managing Pods. When the node goes away so does the Pod. ReplicaSets can be used to ensure one or more replicas of a Pods are always running.

Deployments sit on top of ReplicaSets and add the ability to define how updates to Pods should be rolled out.
